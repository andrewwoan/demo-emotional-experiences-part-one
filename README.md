# ðŸ©µ Demo Emotional Experiences for Codrops ðŸ©µ

This repo contains code of Demo Emotional Experiences for Codrops [Live Site](https://demo-emotional-experiences-part-one.vercel.app/). This is mainly reused code and vibe coded haha, do not look for code accuracy. You can see the graphics I made for the article on this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/gK8fd18nLnmU4dQ6uCBcbu/Codrops-Scene?node-id=0-1&t=5IWbdO7DJ5oEX826-1). The final Blender file is here on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xFMW8nQwN4W-Qfa1BZ5H4ASnn1U4t4gH?usp=sharing).
